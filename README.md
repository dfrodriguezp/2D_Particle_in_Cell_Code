# 2D3V Electrostatic Particle-in-Cell Code

This code was developed in the research group PCM Computational Applications, at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. The aim of the code is to be a tool for the simulation of different plasma phenomena. I write the code for it to be easy to understand, and easy to use to begginers in the computational physics area.

### Usage

The user shall provide a JSON file wich contains all of the information needed to start the simulation.
